# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I made a website that provides the user with a place to store their schedule for their day, with color coded blocks based off of whether it is a past time, the present time, or a future time.

## Usage

The user begins by inputting their task in its respective hour, and pressing the save button. This saves that task to local storage and will display it until the user overrides that save. The color of each time block will also change depending on if that time block has already passed, it is the current time, or if the time has not come yet.
